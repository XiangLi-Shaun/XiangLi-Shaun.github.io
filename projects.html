		<h4 align="justify">Red blood cell (RBC) segmentation and classification from biomedical images is a crucial step for the diagnosis of sickle cell disease (SCD). </h4>
		<p align="center"><img src="./img/project_RBC01.png" /></p>
		<figcaption align="center">Four types of RBCs. Cells of classes 2-4 have more variations in shape and texture, which usually marks a deficit in their functionalities.</figcaption>
		<h4 align="justify">Computer-aided programs that can perform automatic segmentation and classification of RBC images will greatly alleviate labor work of physicians and expedite diagnosis process. A collaborative work between <a href="https://www.ccds.io/">MGH/BWH Center for Clinical Data Science</a> and <a href="http://www.bibdr.org/en/">Center for Data Science at Peking University</a>, we are developing and deploying a semantic segmentation framework to simultaneously detect and classify RBCs from raw microscopic images, called deformable U-Net (dU-net).</h4>
		<p align="center"><img src="./img/project_RBC02.png" /></p>
		<figcaption align="center">Architecture of the dU-Net developed in this project. Notice that deformable convolution layers are used to replace normal convolution in a classical U-Net.</figcaption>
		<h4 align="justify">Testing on preliminary data consisting of 314 images from 5 different SCD patients shows that dU-net framework achieves best segmentation/classification accuracy within an integrated workflow, outperforming both traditional unsupervised methods and classical U-Net structure. The extra deformable operation used in dU-Net makes the prediction model more robust towards variations in the size, shape and viewpoint of the cells (check the deformed sampling locations illustrated in figure below).</h4>

		<h2 id="PMX">Pneumothorax prescreening on CT images:</h2>
		<h4 align="justify">Pneumothorax is a potentially life threatening condition characterized by the abnormal presence of free air in the thorax. Tension pneumothorax is widely considered an emergent critical finding, that requires special communication of the imaging results. For the detection of pneumothorax, timeliness can be challenging when chest CT examinations cannot be reviewed by the radiologists immediately. To address this chanllege, at <a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/Imaging/">MGH Radiology</a> and <a href="https://www.ccds.io/">MGH/BWH Center for Clinical Data Science</a> we are building a deep learning-enabled system to autmatically detect the presence of pneumothorax on chest CT imagesupon completion of scanning. The system can alert the radiologists and other attending providers to reprioritize the CT work list for cases likely to harbor a pneumothorax. </h4>
		<p align="center"><img src="./img/project_PMX01.png" /></p>
		<figcaption align="center">Illustration of the need for a rapid screening system to re-prioritizing the work list for hospital management.</figcaption>
		<h4 align="justify">The pilot system has been tested in a pseudo-online manner with perfect sensitivity, illustrated in the figures below. The system will be further integrated into the clinical workflow at the point of completion of each chest CT scan, making it useful for patients with pre-existing chest diseases that place them at higher risk for pneumothorax, and for patients presenting in the emergency department for rapid triage. </h4>
