			<h2>January, 8th, 2017</h2>
			<h3>Two papers accepted by <a href="biomedicalimaging.org/2017/">ISBI 2017:</a></h3>
			<h3>"Template-guided Functional Network Identification via Supervised Dictionary Learning"</h3>
			<h4>This work is based on the r1DL model previously proposed in my KDD2016 paper. It has shown fast and accurate performance for identifying target functional networks given a set of pre-defined templates from fMRI signals.</h4>
			<h3>"Exploring Human Brain Activation via Nested Sparse Coding and Functional Operators"</h3>
			<h4>The collaboration work with Shu Zhang proposed a highly novel framework which characterizes functional networks as the results of "functional operators" inside the brain, which offers a brand new perspective for brain functional decoding.</h4>

			<h3>"Modeling Functional Dynamics of Cortical Gyri and Sulci"</h3>
			<h4>This work is our preliminary attempt in investigating the differences of functional dynamics between gyri and sulci areas, which are supposed to work in different roles within the brain functional architecture.</h4>
			<h3>"Discover Mouse Gene Coexpression Landscape Using Dictionary Learning and Sparse Coding"</h3>
			<h4>The work from Yujie Li using sparse coding method on the mouse brain gene data obtained surprisingly cleared-edge map of the mouse brain regions.</h4>

			<h4>This work marks the development of "network continnum", a novel concept characterizing the continuous/disruptive dynamics of the functional networks. The model reveals ever-changing spatial patterns of the same networks overtime.</h4>
			<br />
			<h3>"Multiple-Demand System Identification and Characterization Via Sparse Representations of fMRI Data"</h3>
			<h4>This work investigates the well-known multiple-demand system through a network decomposition approach. The work is in sync with our previous Human Brain Mapping paper "Sparse representation of HCP grayordinate data reveals novel functional architecture of cerebral cortex" which focused on MDS on grayordinates (i.e. cortical surface).</h4>
			<br />
			<h3>"Identifying Group-Wise Consistent Sub-Networks Via Spatial Sparse Representation of Natural Stimulus fMRI Data" (collaboration work with Cheng Lyu)</h3>
